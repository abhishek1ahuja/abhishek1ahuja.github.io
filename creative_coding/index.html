		<li> I first made a grid where the colour of each tile flashes randomly. The range of variation was unlimited here, all possible combinations of color are possible. While this was interesting, it is certainly not pleasing to the eye to watch for more than 3 seconds. <a href="glittering_grid_flashy/">View here</a> Also, move around the slider at the bottom to affect how fast the tiles change colors.</li>
		<li> Later I reduced the range of possible colours to +/-30 about a base colour. This retains the nice glittery feeling but it is more comfortable to look at. Additionally, I also added the option for users to change the base colour by clicking anywhere on the canvas. For example, if you click on the blue shoe, the base colour of the background changes to blue. <a href="glittering_grid/">View here</a></li>
